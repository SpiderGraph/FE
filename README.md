## Project Overview

Spider Graph allows creation of spider graphs. You can visualize your business goals, initiatives, timelines, and progress. Lets you express all the ideas youâ€™re going to tackle, and organize them by priority and steps.

## Key Features

### Graph Creation

User can create a new graph selecting the number of arms, points and datasets. Each arm can have points starting from 1 and user can add more as needed. The graph also can include several datasets, that are a polygon with the selected color.

### Graph Editing

When editing user can choose an arm that needs to be modified. By hovering an arm it will be highlighted, and after clicking the data that includes arm`s title and labels will be filled back in the form for the next changes

### Managing the parts of the graph

User can delete arms and points from the menu under the form. 

Some rules are applied to deletion:

* If the point that associated with the edge of the dataset is deleted, then dataset part on that arm will be removed
* if the point that is not the edge of the dataset is deleted, then all datasets that is greater than this point will be reduced
